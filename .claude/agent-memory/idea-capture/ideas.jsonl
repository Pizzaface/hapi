Likely wants persistent state (stays collapsed across navigation) and a clear toggle affordance.","follows":null}
{"id":"idea-032","ts":"2026-02-20T21:00:00Z","type":"feature","pri":2,"title":"Richer session status beyond thinking/online","notes":"Other statuses than just thinking and online","interpretation":"The session list currently only distinguishes 'thinking' (agent mid-turn) and 'online' (connected). User wants more granular statuses visible at a glance — likely things like waiting for permission, running a command, reading/writing files, idle, errored, or completed. This is about situational awareness when managing multiple agents: knowing which ones need attention vs. which are happily working vs. which are stuck.","follows":null}

'5m' '4s' or whatever, subdued, on the session list","interpretation":"Relative time-since-last-activity label on each session row — '4s', '5m', '2h' — in a subdued/muted style so it doesn't compete with the title. Togglable so it can be hidden if unwanted. Live-updating, showing how long since the last message or event. Gives instant triage info: which sessions are fresh vs. stale.","follows":null}

Going back to the session list just shows a bunch of lines that look the same. Not intuitive which one to go back to.","interpretation":"The full session list is the wrong UI for the common mobile workflow of bouncing between 2-3 active agents. All the rows look identical and you have to hunt for the right one every time. The user wants a faster, more differentiated switching mechanism — could be a recent-sessions strip/tab bar, swipe-to-switch gestures, or a compact 'active now' overlay that only shows the few sessions you're currently juggling. The core problem is that the session list treats 'browse all sessions' and 'switch back to one I was just in' as the same interaction, but on mobile they should feel very different.","follows":null}

Special color for when working a bead. Custom statuses/colors — might not be feasible though.","interpretation":"Expanding on idea-032: add a 'waiting/monitoring' status for when an agent is blocked on an external process (CI, build, deploy). Also a distinct visual treatment when a session is working on a bead — connecting the session to its task context visually. The wild card is user-defined custom statuses with custom colors — full personalization of the status system. Feasibility concern is real: custom statuses would need CLI-side reporting (agents would need to emit arbitrary status strings), plus storage, plus UI. Could start with a fixed set of rich statuses and leave custom as a stretch goal.","follows":"idea-032"}

Follow-up: everything except dismissal friction. Should be optimized for viewing CLI commands and JSON — viewport sizing, scrolling, font readability.","interpretation":"When you tap a tool call in the chat to see its inputs and results, the modal that opens is a poor mobile experience. Main issues: viewport sizing, scroll behavior for long outputs, and code/JSON readability at mobile font sizes. Dismissal is fine. The modal needs to be optimized for its primary content types: CLI commands and JSON payloads. Think horizontal scroll for wide lines, proper monospace sizing, syntax-aware formatting.","follows":null}

Currently you have to go find the spawned session in the session list manually. Especially painful on mobile where session discovery is already weak (see idea-034). This is about maintaining the parent-child navigation flow — you're reading the parent's chat, it spawns something, you should be able to follow that thread in one tap.","follows":null}

A one-tap 'silence' button on the rate limit message or notification would suppress further rate limit alerts for that session (or globally). Related to idea-012 (dedupe/suppress rate limit messages) but this is user-initiated muting rather than automatic deduplication. Quick escape hatch when the noise gets annoying.","follows":null}

This distinguishes truly dormant sessions from ones that are just quiet but have unread content waiting. Helps with triage — idle sessions can be visually deprioritized or dimmed in the list.","follows":"idea-032"}
